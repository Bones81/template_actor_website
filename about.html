        <p class="about-text">On any given day, you might find Nathan L. Freeman performing on a stage, on the big screen, on the small screen, on the Internet, or even on the street corner. He performed with Mickey Mouse during the inaugural shows at Hong Kong Disneyland's Castle of Magical Dreams, traveled the country with the National Tour of <em>The 39 Steps</em>, and recorded vocals for the cast albums of <em>Bellevue Sketches</em> and <em>Love Quirks</em>.</p>
        <p class="about-text">Based in New York City, Nathan has studied with David Sabella-Mills in voice and performance and with Austin Pendleton and Ian Marshall at HB Studio. </p>
        <p class="about-text">Nathan attended college at Princeton University where he earned a degree in music theory and composition and received a certificate in theatre. </p>
        <p class="about-text">Nathan grew up in Memphis, Tennessee where he developed an interest in theatre performance as he entered his teens. At Memphis' Orpheum Theatre, touring productions of <em>Les Miserables</em>, <em>Camelot</em>, <em>Rent</em>, <em>Jekyll and Hyde</em>, and <em>Parade</em> inspired him. While the Orpheum showcased big-budget touring shows, local theatres Playhouse on the Square and Circuit Playhouse provided many opportunities to enjoy smaller scale productions. Nathan would eventually land his first professional role as John Darling in Playhouse on the Square's <em>Peter Pan</em> in 1993.</p>
        <p class="about-text">Nathan is a member of AEA and SAG-AFTRA.</p>
